Make front page links go to the post's category page instead. Useful for increasing page views.

== Description ==

This is a Wordpress plugin that will make your front page link jump to the
post's category page instead of the actual post page.

This is useful for increasing page views (and ad impressions), and making a site act more like
a traditional newspaper. In the olden days you would read part of an article on
the front page, and then open the paper up to the right section to continue.

It's also great for annoying readers, but you need those ad impressions!
